# OI
## Once Upon a Time
- I once learned to draw with $\texttt{Js}$, and later explored languages like $\texttt{Scratch}$ and $\texttt{Python}$. Overall, I spent quite a bit of time on this.

- After learning the basics of C++, STL, brute force search, dynamic programming, and some simple algorithms, I still couldn't dive deep into problem-solving.

## 2023
### January 2023
- Teacher Fu suggested that I start solving problems, focusing on CF 1500 level questions.
### July 2023
- I entered Jiaochuan Academy and found that under the dual pressure of OI and academic courses, the learning journey was exceptionally tough, and I could choose to retire at any moment. I couldn't help but wonder if I could truly find peace if I distanced myself from OI. Many of my classmates had already become AFO, and I didn't want to be the next one. However, the confusion in my heart often made me lose myself in it.
### October 2023
- I eventually achieved some results with CSP-J 335 and CSP-S 150.

## 2024
### January 2024
- I participated in the winter camp at PKU, but the results were not satisfactory.
### May 2024
- I took part in the summer camps at PKU and TSU, but my results still showed little improvement.
### July 2024
- That period was indeed filled with many difficulties, and my parents' attitude became increasingly clearâ€”if I couldn't achieve my goals in the CSP exam in October, there would be no need to continue studying information technology.
- I reflected that over the past year and a half, my ability to tackle CF problems didn't seem to improve significantly, always hovering between *1800 and *2100.
- In such circumstances, I couldn't help but wonder if AFO was truly the way out or if it would cause me to miss out on future glory.
- I tirelessly fought to reverse my fate in OI, immersing myself daily in linear algebra, combinatorial mathematics, probability, and OI problems. The stark contrast between my former confidence and my current helplessness was evident, and I had even been gradually surpassed by my juniors. I have no regrets about entering OI; despite the difficulties, I am willing to stay true to my original intention.

# Words to OI

Over the past two years in OI, I have transformed from a child who couldn't even spell `include` into one who can write efficient code and solve problems effectively.

# To My Classmates Who Are Now AFO
On the journey of OI, there is a group of people who shine like stars, radiating unique brilliance. They are the classmates who once fought alongside me, sharing dreams together. They have now become AFO, returning to academic courses, yet still exuding the glow of time's accumulation.

I extend my highest respect to them, thanking them for fighting alongside me and adding color and light to the dream of OI. Although we now shine on different stages, the love for OI in our hearts will never fade.

On the road of OI, everyone has their own rhythm; no one is better than the other. We all showcase our unique styles in different fields. Let us pay tribute to those classmates who tirelessly pursue their dreams, wishing you all continue to shine brightly and achieve even more glorious lives in your future journeys.
